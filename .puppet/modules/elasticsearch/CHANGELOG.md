## x.x.x (Month Day, Year)

#### Features

#### Fixes

## 6.3.4 (August 7, 2019)

#### Puppet < 4.10 No Longer Supported

Puppet 4.10.0 is the new minimum required version of Puppet.

#### Fixes
* The Elasticsearch log directory is no longer recursively managed to avoid stomping on the user/mode settings that Elasticsearch prefers.
* Package management on apt-based systems no longer encounters dependency errors when `manage_repo => false`.
* Plugin configuration files are now more well-supported by respecting subdirectory copy recursion. See `elasticsearch::configdir_recurselimit` for more information.
* An error related to elasticsearch_roles and `yield` errors has been fixed
* Correctly permit instances to be set to `absent` without errors.

## 6.3.3 (September 7, 2018)

Note that this release includes changes to a default value that may affect users that rely on `curl` or `wget` to retrieve Elasticsearch package files, as now all certificates are validated by default.
To preserve existing behavior, set `$elasticsearch::download_tool_verify_certificates` to `false`.

#### Fixes
* Update puppetlabs-stdlib dependency to < 6.0.0
* By default, package files downloaded with tools like wget or curl (i.e., the `$elasticsearch::download_tool` parameter) now verify certificates by default and a new boolean parameter has been added to indicate whether to ignore certificates (`$elasticsearch::download_tool_verify_certificates`).

## 6.3.2 (August 28, 2018)

#### Fixes
* Fix an issue with string coercion for certain fields in pipelines.

## 6.3.1 (August 6, 2018)

Primarily a bugfix release.

#### Fixes
* REST-based resources are now coerced to string values to uniformly compare user defined values and Elasticsearch API responses.
* Resolve deprecation warnings related to use of the deprecated is_array() function.
* Fixed an erroneous inclusion of '<' in logging.yml
* Resolve deprecation warnings related to use of the deprecated is_string() function.

## 6.3.0 (June 18, 2018)

### Migration Guide

Elasticsearch 6.3 includes several big changes that are reflected in this module.
When upgrading from module versions prior to 6.3, there are a number of upgrade considerations to take into account:

* This module defaults to the upstream package repositories, which now include X-Pack bundled by default. To preserve previous behavior which does _not_ include X-Pack, follow the `README` instructions to configure `oss`-only repositories/packages.
  * Note that if your system was previously using the `elasticsearch` package and you instead choose to move to the `oss` distribution, the `elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch-oss` packages may conflict. If that occurs, consider ensuring that the `elasticsearch` package is absent before the `::elasticsearch` class runs. This module does not explicitly remove the conflicting package to avoid unexpected package removal.
* Use of the `elastic_stack::repo` class for managing package repositories brings a couple changes:
  * All repository-level parameters and settings have been removed from the `::elasticsearch` class. These parameters can now be set on the `elastic_stack::repo` class.
  * This may mean that leftover yum/apt/etc. repositories named `elasticsearch` may persist after upgrade.
* Some changes have been made to align this module's file-level permissions with upstream defaults on some configuration, data, and logging directories. Though these have been tested, operators should be aware that some permissions may change on-disk after upgrading to version >= 6.3.x of this module.

#### Features
* Added support for managing Elasticsearch licenses.
* This module now uses the elastic-stack module to manage package repositories.
* Supports OSS packaging distribution.
* X-Pack bundled with 6.3 support.

#### Fixes
* Ensure that the stock Elasticsearch service is not running.
* Service files for removed instances were previously set to ensure => absent on removal. Because this limits Puppet's ability to verify that the named service is running or not, these service files are always present now whether an instance is set to present or absent.
* The service defaults file now enforces user/group ownership inline with the service user runtime.
* The `scripts` configuration directory is now recursively copied instead of symlinked to avoid Elasticsearch security manager permission errors.
* X-Pack and other meta-plugins are now properly detected as installed by the native plugin provider.

## 6.2.2 (March 13, 2018)

#### Fixes
* Fixed language compatibility errors that could arise when using JRuby 1.7 on Puppet Servers.

## 6.2.1 (February 14, 2018)

This is primarily a bugfix release to address an issue when installing Elasticsearch 6.2.x plugins such as X-Pack that use the new meta-plugin architecture.
While the change has been tested with several plugins and versions of Elasticsearch, if any unexpected behavior arises, help is available on the [Elastic forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) or via [an issue in the puppet-elasticsearch Github repository](https://github.com/elastic/puppet-elasticsearch/issues).

#### Fixes
* Rewrote the `exists?` logic for the `elasticsearch_plugin` provider. This fundamentally changes how the module detects the presence of plugins but should be backwards compatible.

## 6.2.0 (February 9, 2018)

#### Features
* Add support for Amazon Linux 2
* Add support for managing Elasticsearch Snapshot Repository resources

#### Fixes
* Fixed an issue when setting `file_rolling_type => file` in Elasticsearch 6.
* Removed ExecStartPre=- from systemd template

## 6.1.0 (December 18, 2017)

#### Features
* Removed `tea` module dependency for pre-existing types in `stdlib` module.
* Support `file` as a `file_rolling_type`.
* Added `java_opts` parameter to `elasticsearch::plugin` resource.
* Brought some options in `jvm.options` up-to-date with upstream.
* Plugins can now have their `JAVA_HOME` set through the `java_home` parameter.

#### Fixes
* Fixed issue with `ES_PATH_CONF` being unset in SysV init files.

## 6.0.0 (November 14, 2017)

Major version upgrade with several important deprecations:

* Puppet version 3 is no longer supported.
* Package pinning is no longer supported.
* Java installation is no longer supported.
* The python and ruby defined types have been removed.
* Repo management through `manage_repo` is now set to `true` by default.
* All `*_hiera_merge` parameters have been removed.

Minor:

* elasticsearch::plugin only accepts `present` or `absent`
* Some REST-resource based providers (such as templates and pipelines) now validate parameters (such as numeric port numbers) more rigorously.

The following migration guide is intended to help aid in upgrading this module.

### Migration Guide

#### Puppet 3.x No Longer Supported

Puppet 4.5.0 is the new minimum required version of Puppet, which offers better safety, module metadata, and Ruby features.
Migrating from Puppet 3 to Puppet 4 is beyond the scope of this guide, but the [official upgrade documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/upgrade/upgrade_steps.html) can help.
As with any version or module upgrade, remember to restart any agents and master servers as needed.

#### Package Pinning No Longer Supported

Package pinning caused lots of unexpected behavior and usually caused more problems than solutions.
If you still require package pinning, consider using the [`apt::pin` resource](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt#pin-a-specific-release) on Debian-based systems or a [`yum::versionlock` resource from the yum module](https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/yum#lock-a-package-with-the-versionlock-plugin) for Red Hat-based systems.

#### Java Installation No Longer Supported

Java installation was a very simple operation in this module which simply declared an instance of the `java` class but created conflicts for users who managed Java separately.
If you still wish to configure Java alongside this module, consider using the [puppetlabs/java](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/java) module and installing Java with the following configuration:

```puppet
class { "java" : distribution => "jre" }
```

This will install a version of Java suitable for Elasticsearch in most situations.
Note that in some older distributions, you may need to take extra steps to install a more recent version of Java that supports Elasticsearch.

#### Removal of Python and Ruby Resources

These resource types were simple wrappers around `package` resources with their providers set to `pip` and `gem`, respectively.
Simply defining your own resources similarly to:

```puppet
package { 'elasticsearch' : provider => 'pip' }
```

Is sufficient.

#### Automatic Package Repository Management

This parameter is now set to `true` by default to automatically manage the Elastic repository.
If you do not wish to configure the repository to automatically retrieve package updates, set this parameter to `false`:

```puppet
class { 'elasticsearch': manage_repo => false }
```

#### Removal of `hiera_merge` Parameters

Updates to Hiera in later versions of Puppet mean that you can set merging behavior in end-user configuration.
Read [the upstream Hiera documentation regarding `lookup_options`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/4.10/hiera_merging.html#configuring-merge-behavior-in-hiera-data) to learn how to configure Hiera appropriately for your needs.

## 5.5.0 (November 13, 2017)

## 5.4.0 (August 3, 2017)

#### Features
* The `api_timeout` parameter is now passed to the `es_instance_conn_validator` resource for index, pipeline, and template defined types.
* Updated puppetlabs/apt dependency to < 5.0.0.
* Both the `logging.yml` and `log4j2.properties` files can be selectively enabled/disabled with the `logging_yml_ensure` and `log4j2_ensure` parameters on the `elasticsearch` class and `elasticsearch::instance` defined type.
* `jvm_options` are now controllable on a per-instance basis.

#### Fixes
* Fixed an edge case with `es_instance_validator` in which ruby connection errors were not caught.
* Plugins with colon-delimited names (such as maven plugins) are properly handled now.
* Fixed a bug that would cause dependency cycles when using parameters to create defined types.

## 5.3.1 (June 14, 2017)

### Summary

## 5.2.0 (May 5, 2017)

### Summary
Release supporting several new features and bugfixes for 5.4.0 users and users who need the ability to update plugins.

#### Features
* Support for Shield/X-Pack logging configuration file added.

* Fixed deprecated `default.path` options introduced in Elasticsearch 5.4.0.

## 5.1.1 (April 13, 2017)

### Summary

#### Features
* Instance configs now have highest precedence when constructing the final yaml
    config file.

#### Fixes
This is a hotfix release to support users affected by [an upstream Elasticsearch issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6887).
See the [associated issue](https://github.com/elastic/puppet-elasticsearch/issues/802#issuecomment-293295930) for details regarding the workaround.
The change implemented in this release is to place the `elasticsearch::instance` `config` parameter at the highest precedence when merging the final config yaml which permits users manually override `path.data` values.

## 5.1.0 (February 28, 2017)

### Summary
Ingest pipeline and index settings support.
Minor bugfixes.

#### Features
* Ingestion pipelines supported via custom resources.

* `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers properly set for providers (to support ES 6.x)

## 5.0.0 (February 9, 2017)

Going forward, This module will follow Elasticsearch's upstream major version to indicate compatability.
That is, version 5.x of this module supports version 5 of Elasticsearch, and version 6.x of this module will be released once Elasticsearch 6 support is added.

### Summary
Note that this is a **major version release**!
Please read the release notes carefully before upgrading to avoid downtime/unexpected behavior.
Remember to restart any puppetmaster servers to clear provider caches and pull in updated code.

### Backwards-Incompatible Changes
* The `elasticsearch::shield::user` and `elasticsearch::shield::role` resources have been renamed to `elasticsearch::user` and `elasticsearch::role` since the resource now handles both Shield and X-Pack.
* Both Shield and X-Pack configuration files are kept in `/etc/elasticsearch/shield` and `/etc/elasticsearch/x-pack`, respectively. If you previously managed Shield resources with version 0.x of this module, you may need to migrate files from `/usr/share/elasticsearch/shield`.
* The default data directory has been changed to `/var/lib/elasticsearch`. If you used the previous default (the Elasticsearch home directory, `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data`), you may need to migrate your data.
* The first changes that may be Elasticsearch 1.x-incompatible have been introduced (see the [elasticsearch support lifecycle](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)). This only impacts version 1.x running on systemd-based distributions.
* sysctl management has been removed (and the module removed as a dependency for this module), and puppet/yum is used in lieu of ceritsc/yum.

#### Features
* Support management of the global jvm.options configuration file.
* X-Pack support added.
* Restricted permissions to the elasticsearch.yml file.
* Deprecation log configuration support added.
* Synced systemd service file with upstream.

#### Bugfixes
* Fixed case in which index template could prepend an additional 'index.' to index settings.
* Fixed a case in which dependency cycles could arise when pinning packages on CentOS.
* No longer recursively change the Elasticsearch home directory's lib/ to the elasticsearch user.
* Unused defaults values now purged from instance init defaults files.

#### Changes
* Changed default data directory to /var/lib
* sysctl settings are no longer managed by the thias/sysctl module.
* Calls to `elasticsearch -version` in elasticsearch::plugin code replaced with native Puppet code to resolve Elasticsearch package version. Should improve resiliency when managing plugins.
* Shield and X-Pack configuration files are stored in /etc/elasticsearch instead of /usr/share/elasticsearch.
* Removed deprecated ceritsc/yum module in favor of puppet/yum.

#### Testing changes

### Summary
Primarily a bugfix release for issues related to plugin proxy functionality, various system service fixes, and directory permissions.
This release also adds the ability to define logging rolling file settings and a CA file/path for template API access.

#### Features
* Added 'file_rolling_type' parameter to allow selecting file logging rotation type between "dailyRollingFile" or "rollingFile". Also added 'daily_rolling_date_pattern', 'rolling_file_max_backup_index' and 'rolling_file_max_file_size' for file rolling customization.

#### Bugfixes
* Permissions on the Elasticsearch plugin directory have been fixed to permit world read rights.
* The service systemd unit now `Wants=` a network target to fix bootup parallelization problems.
* Recursively create the logdir for elasticsearch when creating multiple instances
* Files and directories with root ownership now specify UID/GID 0 instead to improve compatability with *BSDs.
* Elasticsearch Debian init file changed to avoid throwing errors when DATA_DIR, WORK_DIR and/or LOG_DIR were an empty variable.
* Fixed a broken File dependency when a plugin was set to absent and ::elasticsearch set to present.
* Fixed issue when using the `proxy` parameter on plugins in Elasticsearch 2.x.

#### Changes

* Updated the es_instance_conn_validator type to silence deprecation warnings in Puppet >= 4.

#### Testing changes

## 0.13.1 (August 8, 2016)

### Summary
Lingering bugfixes from elasticsearch::template changes.
More robust systemd mask handling.
Updated some upstream module parameters for deprecation warnings.
Support for the Shield `system_key` file.

#### Features
* Added `system_key` parameter to the `elasticsearch` class and `elasticsearch::instance` type for placing Shield system keys.

#### Bugfixes
* Fixed systemd elasticsearch.service unit masking to use systemctl rather than raw symlinking to avoid puppet file backup errors.
* Fixed a couple of cases that broke compatability with older versions of puppet (elasticsearch_template types on puppet versions prior to 3.6 and yumrepo parameters on puppet versions prior to 3.5.1)
* Fixed issues that caused templates to be incorrectly detected as out-of-sync and thus always changed on each puppet run.
* Resources are now explicitly ordered to ensure behavior such as plugins being installed before instance start, users managed before templates changed, etc.

#### Changes
* Updated repository gpg fingerprint key to long form to silence module warnings.

#### Testing changes

## 0.13.0 (August 1, 2016)

### Summary
Rewritten elasticsearch::template using native type and provider.
Fixed and added additional proxy parameters to elasticsearch::plugin instances.
Exposed repo priority parameters for apt and yum repos.

#### Features
* In addition to better consistency, the `elasticsearch::template` type now also accepts various `api_*` parameters to control how access to the Elasticsearch API is configured (there are top-level parameters that are inherited and can be overwritten in `elasticsearch::api_*`).
* The `elasticsearch::config` parameter now supports deep hiera merging.
* Added the `elasticsearch::repo_priority` parameter to support apt and yum repository priority configuration.
* Added `proxy_username` and `proxy_password` parameters to `elasticsearch::plugin`.

#### Bugfixes
* Content of templates should now properly trigger new API PUT requests when the index template stored in Elasticsearch differs from the template defined in puppet.
* Installing plugins with proxy parameters now works correctly due to changed Java property flags.
* The `elasticsearch::plugin::module_dir` parameter has been re-implemented to aid in working around plugins with non-standard plugin directories.

#### Changes
* The `file` parameter on the `elasticsearch::template` defined type has been deprecated to be consistent with usage of the `source` parameter for other types.

#### Testing changes

## 0.12.0 (July 20, 2016)

IMPORTANT! A bug was fixed that mistakenly added /var/lib to the list of DATA_DIR paths on Debian-based systems.  This release removes that environment variable, which could potentially change path.data directories for instances of Elasticsearch.  Take proper precautions when upgrading to avoid unexpected downtime or data loss (test module upgrades, et cetera).

### Summary
Rewritten yaml generator, code cleanup, and various bugfixes. Configuration file yaml no longer nested. Service no longer restarts by default, and exposes more granular restart options.

#### Features
* The additional parameters restart_config_change, restart_package_change, and restart_plugin_change have been added for more granular control over service restarts.

#### Bugfixes
* Special yaml cases such as arrays of hashes and strings like "::" are properly supported.
* Previous Debian SysV init scripts mistakenly set the `DATA_DIR` environment variable to a non-default value.
* Some plugins failed installation due to capitalization munging, the elasticsearch_plugin provider no longer forces downcasing.

#### Changes
* The `install_options` parameter on the `elasticsearch::plugin` type has been removed. This was an undocumented parameter that often caused problems for users.
* The `elasticsearch.service` systemd unit is no longer removed but masked by default, effectively hiding it from systemd but retaining the upstream vendor unit on disk for package management consistency.
* `restart_on_change` now defaults to false to reduce unexpected cluster downtime (can be set to true if desired).
* Package pinning is now contained within a separate class, so users can opt to manage package repositories manually and still use this module's pinning feature.
* All configuration hashes are now flattened into dot-notated yaml in the elasticsearch configuration file. This should be fairly transparent in terms of behavior, though the config file formatting will change.

#### Testing changes
* The acceptance test suite has been dramatically slimmed to cut down on testing time and reduce false positives.
