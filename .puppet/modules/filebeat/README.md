## Description

The `filebeat` module installs and configures the [filebeat log shipper](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) maintained by elastic.

## Setup

### What filebeat affects

By default `filebeat` adds a software repository to your system, and installs filebeat along
with required configurations.

### Upgrading to Filebeat 7.x

To upgrade to Filebeat 7.x, simply set `$filebeat::major_version` to `7` and `$filebeat::package_ensure` to `latest` (or whichever version of 7.x you want, just not present).

You'll also need to change instances of `filebeat::prospector` to `filebeat::input` when upgrading to version 4.x of
this module.


### Setup Requirements

The `filebeat` module depends on [`puppetlabs/stdlib`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib), and on
[`puppetlabs/apt`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt) on Debian based systems.

### Beginning with filebeat

`filebeat` can be installed with `puppet module install pcfens-filebeat` (or with r10k, librarian-puppet, etc.)

The only required parameter, other than which files to ship, is the `outputs` parameter.

## Usage

All of the default values in filebeat follow the upstream defaults (at the time of writing).

To ship files to [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#elasticsearch-output):
```puppet
class { 'filebeat':
  outputs => {
    'elasticsearch' => {
     'hosts' => [
       'http://localhost:9200',
       'http://anotherserver:9200'
     ],
     'loadbalance' => true,
     'cas'         => [
        '/etc/pki/root/ca.pem',
     ],
    },
  },
}

```

To ship log files through [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#logstash-output):
```puppet
class { 'filebeat':
  outputs => {
    'logstash'     => {
     'hosts' => [
       'localhost:5044',
       'anotherserver:5044'
     ],
     'loadbalance' => true,
    },
  },
}

```

[Shipper](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#configuration-shipper) and
[logging](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#configuration-logging) options
can be configured the same way, and are documented on the [elastic website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html).

### Adding an Input

Inputs are processes that ship log files to elasticsearch or logstash. They can
be defined as a hash added to the class declaration (also used for automatically creating
input using hiera), or as their own defined resources.

At a minimum, the `paths` parameter must be set to an array of files or blobs that should
be shipped. `doc_type` is what logstash views as the type parameter if you'd like to
apply conditional filters.

```puppet
filebeat::input { 'syslogs':
  paths    => [
    '/var/log/auth.log',
    '/var/log/syslog',
  ],
  doc_type => 'syslog-beat',
}
```

#### Multiline Logs

Filebeat inputs can handle multiline log entries. The `multiline`
parameter accepts a hash containing `pattern`, `negate`, `match`, `max_lines`, and `timeout`
as documented in the filebeat [configuration documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/multiline-examples.html).

#### JSON Logs

Filebeat inputs (versions >= 5.0) can natively decode JSON objects if they are stored one per line. The `json`
parameter accepts a hash containing `message_key`, `keys_under_root`, `overwrite_keys`, and `add_error_key`
as documented in the filebeat [configuration documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/5.5/configuration-filebeat-options.html#config-json).

### Inputs in Hiera

Inputs can be defined in hiera using the `inputs` parameter. By default, hiera will not merge
input declarations down the hiera hierarchy. That behavior can be changed by configuring the
[lookup_options](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lookup_quick.html#setting-lookupoptions-in-data)
flag.

### Usage on Windows

When installing on Windows, this module will download the windows version of Filebeat from
[elastic](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat) to `C:\Temp` by default. The directory
can be overridden using the `tmp_dir` parameter. `tmp_dir` is not managed by this module,
but is expected to exist as a directory that puppet can write to.

### Processors

Filebeat 5.0 and greater includes a new libbeat feature for filtering and/or enhancing all
exported data through processors before being sent to the configured output(s). They can be
defined as a hash added to the class declaration (also used for automatically creating
processors using hiera), or as their own defined resources.

To drop the offset and input_type fields from all events:

```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => {
    "drop_fields" => {
      "fields" => ["input_type", "offset"],
    },
  },
}
```

To drop all events that have the http response code equal to 200:
input
```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => {
    "drop_event" => {
      "when" => {"equals" => {"http.code" => 200}}
    },
  },
}
```

Now to combine these examples into a single definition:

```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => {
    "drop_fields" => {
      "params"   => {"fields" => ["input_type", "offset"]},
      "priority" => 1,
    },
    "drop_event" => {
      "when"     => {"equals" => {"http.code" => 200}},
      "priority: => 2,
    },
  },
}
```

For more information please review the documentation [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/5.1/configuration-processors.html).

#### Processors in Hiera

Processors can be declared in hiera using the `processors` parameter. By default, hiera will not merge
processor declarations down the hiera hierarchy. That behavior can be changed by configuring the
[lookup_options](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lookup_quick.html#setting-lookupoptions-in-data)
flag.

## Limitations
This module doesn't load the [elasticsearch index template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-getting-started.html#filebeat-template) into elasticsearch (required when shipping
directly to elasticsearch).

When installing on Windows, there's an expectation that `C:\Temp` already exists, or an alternative
location specified in the `tmp_dir` parameter exists and is writable by puppet. The temp directory
is used to store the downloaded installer only.

### Generic template

By default, a generic, open ended template is used that simply converts your configuration into
a hash that is produced as YAML on the system. To use a template that is more strict, but possibly
incomplete, set `conf_template` to `filebeat/filebeat.yml.erb`.

### Debian Systems

Filebeat 5.x and newer requires apt-transport-https, but this module won't install it for you.

### Using config_file
There are a few very specific use cases where you don't want this module to directly manage the filebeat
configuration file, but you still want the configuration file on the system at a different location.
Setting `config_file` will write the filebeat configuration file to an alternate location, but it will not
update the init script. If you don't also manage the correct file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml on Linux,
C:/Program Files/Filebeat/filebeat.yml on Windows) then filebeat won't be able to start.

If you're copying the alternate config file location into the real location you'll need to include some
metaparameters like
```puppet
file { '/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml':
  ensure  => file,
  source  => 'file:///etc/filebeat/filebeat.special',
  require => File['filebeat.yml'],
  notify  => Service['filebeat'],
}
```
to ensure that services are managed like you might expect.
