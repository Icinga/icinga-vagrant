**Breaking Changes**
- Processors are managed by their own defined resource (slight syntax change) [\#85](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/pull/85)

  can cause problems (duplicate or missed log entries), so you may want to point it

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/compare/v0.7.4...v0.8.0)

**Enhancements**
- Add support for Filebeat v5.

If you use this module on a system with filebeat 1.x installed, and you keep your current parameters
nothing will change. Setting `major_version` to '5' will modify the configuration template and update
package repositories, but won't update the package itself. To update the package set the
`package_ensure` parameter to at least 5.0.0.

- Add a parameter `use_generic_template` that uses a more generic version of the configuration
  template. The generic template is more future proof (if types are correct), but looks
  very different than the example file.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0)

- For prospectors, deprecate `log_type` in favor of `doc_type` to better
  match the actual configuration parameter. `document_type` is not used because
  it causes errors when running with a puppet master. `log_type` will be fully
  removed before module version 1.0.

**New Features**

**Fixed Bugs**
- Fix links in documentation to match the updated documentation

**New Features**
- Change repository resource names to beats (e.g. apt::source['beats'], etc.),
  and only declare them if they haven't already been declared. This way we only
  have one module for all beats modules managed through puppet.
