## x.x.x (Month Day, Year)

### Migration Guide

#### Puppet < 4.10 No Longer Supported

Puppet 4.10.0 is the new minimum required version of Puppet.

#### Features

#### Fixes

## 6.3.1 (October 19, 2018)

#### Fixes
* This module no longer requires or enforces a version of the puppetlabs/apt module, which is transitively handled through the `elastic/elastic_stack` dependency.
* Permit hashes to be passed as configuration parameter values.

## 6.3.0 (June 18, 2018)

This release deprecates Kibana 4.x, which is end-of-life.

### Migration Guide

* Support for 4.x has been deprecated, so consider upgrading to Kibana 5 or later before upgrading this module since only versions 5 and later are supported.
* The module defaults to the upstream package repositories, which now include X-Pack bundled by default. To preserve previous behavior which does _not_ include X-Pack, follow the `README` instructions to configure `oss`-only repositories/packages.
* Use of the `elastic_stack::repo` class for managing package repositories may mean that leftover yum/apt/etc. repositories named `kibana` may persist after upgrade.

#### Features
* Support for 6.3 style repositories using elastic_stack module

#### Fixes

## 6.0.1 (March 13, 2018)
