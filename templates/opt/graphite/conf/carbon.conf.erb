# sorted - All metrics in the cache will be counted and an ordered list of

# moment of the list's creation. Metrics will then be flushed from the cache to

#

# that has the most datapoints. This will give a strong flush preference to
# frequently updated metrics and will also reduce random file-io. Infrequently
# updated metrics may only ever be persisted to disk at daemon shutdown if
# there are a large number of metrics which receive very frequent updates OR if
# disk i/o is very slow.

# naive - Metrics will be flushed from the cache to disk in an unordered

# the OS's i/o scheduler is expected to compensate for the random write
